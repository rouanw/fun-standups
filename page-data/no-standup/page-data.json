Give your team some time to unwind. Do the right conversations still happen?","contributor":{"github":"rouanw"},"description":"What if skipping standup actually helps you be more productive today? Not having standup can reveal whether your team is overly reliant on your daily meeting to communicate and co-ordinate. If not having standup means work doesn't get done, you likely have some communication issues to deal with.\n\nCancelling standup is also a fantastic way to give your team enough time to take a little break. You can even encourage specific activities, like taking a walk, reading a book, or all doing the same 15-minute yoga video.","benefits":["Give your team a chance to look after themselves","Make sure the communication channels outside standup are open"],"tags":["Communication"]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2307624284","3649515864"]}
